            <h2>Our mission: the simple, smart alternative to complex seo tools</h2> 
            
            <p>SparkWord was founded to solve a singular, critical problem: efficiently finding low-competition, long-tail keywords. While many platforms offer complex, multi-functional dashboards, most content creators only need one thing: actionable, targeted keywords. We eliminate the noise and the high cost.</p>
